"""Rank-biased overlap, a ragged sorted list similarity measure.
See http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1852102.1852106 for details. All functions
directly corresponding to concepts from the paper are named so that they can be
clearly cross-identified.
The definition of overlap has been modified to account for ties. Without this,
results for lists with tied items were being inflated. The modification itself
is not mentioned in the paper but seems to be reasonable, see function
``overlap()``. Places in the code which diverge from the spec in the paper
because of this are highlighted with comments.
The two main functions for performing an RBO analysis are ``rbo()`` and
``rbo_dict()``; see their respective docstrings for how to use them.
The following doctest just checks that equivalent specifications of a
problem yield the same result using both functions:
    >>> lst1 = [{"c", "a"}, "b", "d"]
    >>> lst2 = ["a", {"c", "b"}, "d"]
    >>> ans_rbo = _round(rbo(lst1, lst2, p=.9))
    >>> dct1 = dict(a=1, b=2, c=1, d=3)
    >>> dct2 = dict(a=1, b=2, c=2, d=3)
    >>> ans_rbo_dict = _round(rbo_dict(dct1, dct2, p=.9, sort_ascending=True))
    >>> ans_rbo == ans_rbo_dict
    True
